# What is Siri?
Siri is the intelligent assistant from Apple, it makes it easy for people to accomplish everyday tasks quickly, using voice, touch, or automation. 

# How this project was done?
To use Siri in this app I had to implement SiriKit which allows users to interact with their devices through voice, intelligent suggestions, and personalized workflows. 

To implement SiriKit I created a shopping list app in SwiftUI, a CoreData database to save items in local storage, and designed custom Intents.

# What is the final result?
In this project, we'll have a view to display the items to buy and a view with input to add new items.
